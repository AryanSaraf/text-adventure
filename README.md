# Text Adventure
- This is a game created as the 4th task of my internship with MotionCut.
- It is a text-based RPG that features multiple storylines along with multiple endings based on choices selected by the user.
- Many scenarios depend on fate, making the game a tad more realistic.
- This is compounded by the fact that different items are of varying significance to different characters, with locations having real distances in the game's universe.
- The story is detailed and is best experienced as a player, but be prepared to read (sometimes lengthy) descriptions to understand what is going on.
